## AI Integration

The app calls the **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** model (`gemini-2.0-flash`) via the `v1beta` REST API to generate two pieces of content in parallel:

- A personalized health analysis paragraph (~150–200 words)
- Two specific, actionable health recommendations

If the API call fails or returns an empty response, the app automatically falls back to built-in static content based on the user's BMI category and goal.

> ⚠️ **Security Note:** The API key is currently hardcoded in `lib/services/gemini_service.dart`. Before deploying or sharing this project publicly, move the key to a secure location such as environment variables, a `.env` file excluded from version control, or a backend proxy.

The project is configured for Android, iOS, Web, macOS, Linux, and Windows.
